Any known issues will be documented here.

{{% notice style="important" %}}

Issues related to an HVM module must be raised on the repo they are hosted on, not the HVM Central (`johnknutsonhc/Hennepin-Verified-Modules`) repo!

Although, if you think a known issue is missing from this page please create an issue on the HVM Central [`johnknutsonhc/Hennepin-Verified-Modules`](https://github.com/johnknutsonhc/Hennepin-Verified-Modules/issues/new/choose) repo.

*If you accidentally raise an issue in the wrong place, we will transfer it to its correct home. üëç*
