This QuickStart guide offers step-by-step instructions for integrating Hennepin Verified Modules (HVM) into your solutions. It includes the initial setup, essential tools, and configurations required to deploy and manage your resources efficiently using HVM.

## Using Hennepin Verified Modules

Using HVM ensures that your infrastructure-as-code deployments follow Hennepin County's best practices and guidelines, providing a consistent and reliable foundation for your cloud solutions. HVM helps accelerate your development process, reduce the risk of misconfigurations, and enhance the security and compliance of your applications.

## Default values

Where provided, default values should be generally safe, following best practices and ensuring a secure and reliable setup. However, it is important to review these values to ensure they meet your specific requirements and compliance needs. Customizing the default values may be necessary to align with the specific needs of your solution.

## Exploring examples and module features

You can find examples and detailed documentation for each HVM module in their respective code repository's `README.MD` file, which details inputs, examples, etc.

## Development environment setup

Required software includes:

- Terraform (> v1.6.0)
